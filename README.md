# Identifying-ADHD-Brain-Network

In our analysis we leveraged the Nipye and Nilearn python libraries to generate network graphs from MRI scans. We were able to generate correlation matrices of the MRI scans by extracting a time series from the scan's metadata. The Nodes were generated in a bimodal fashion using a brain atlas in conjunction with the active regions of the scans. These nodes with the supporting time series allowed us to measure the connectivity between the nodes using the ConnectivityMeasure functions. After generating an adjacency matrix for each scan we ran an averaged correlation across all ten scans to generate the final matrix used to plot our network graph. 82 Nodes were generated with their local activity and correlations between nodes being plotted as the connecting edges.
